  <h1>Arima</h1>
  <p>Arima is the easternmost and second largest in area of the three boroughs of Trinidad and Tobago. 
    It is geographically adjacent to Sangre Grande and Arouca at the southcentral foothills of the Northern Range, 
    and to the south is the Caroni-Arena Dam; in addition, Coterminous with Town of Arima since 1888, the borough of 
    Arima is the fourth-largest municipality in population in the country (after Port of Spain, Chaguanas and San Fernando),
    with a census-estimated 33,606[1] residents in 2011.</p>
  <p>The town petitioned Queen Victoria for municipal status as part of her Golden Jubilee in 1887. This was granted in the following year, and Arima became a Royal Borough on 1 August 1888. Historically, the third town of Trinidad and Tobago, Arima has slid into fourth place as Chaguanas became the largest town in the country.</p>
